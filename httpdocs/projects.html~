      	<h3>New York Knicks and Rangers Offical Apps</h3>
      	<p>
      		My largest project during my time at YinzCam was the Official New York Knicks and New York Rangers apps.  As the project lead, I handled all communication between YinzCam and the Madison Square Garden project team.  During the project, I managed daily stand-up calls with the team at MSG, and translated requirements to the YinzCam development team.  This project included several third party integrations to the standard YinzCam platform as well as many customizations.  Despite the customizations, the apps released on time before the NHL and NBA seasons.

      	<img src="img/ribbit.png" id="ribbit-img" class="lefty group">
      	<p class="righty group">
      		Ribbit is an app designed by <a href="www.teamtreehouse.com/markwesterlund">TeamTreehouse.com</a> to teach Android programming. It is a Snap-chat style app in which you send images and videos to friends, that expire ten seconds after opening.  It is build for Android devices, and uses Parse as the back-end.  The app is not in the Google Play store because it is not my own design, however, I would be happy to distribute it via an .apk file.
